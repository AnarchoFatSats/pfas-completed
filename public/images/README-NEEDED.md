# Image Needed: PFAS Map Preview

For the AreYouAtRisk component, we need a new image:

## Required Image
- Filename: `pfas-map-preview.jpg`
- Purpose: Static preview of PFAS contamination map
- Recommended size: 1200x800px
- Placement: public/images/pfas-map-preview.jpg

## Suggestions
- This should be a screenshot or static image of a PFAS contamination map
- You can use a screenshot from the EWG map: https://www.ewg.org/interactive-maps/2021_suspected_industrial_discharges_of_pfas/map/
- Alternatively, create a heatmap visualization showing PFAS hotspots across the US
- Ensure the image is optimized for web (under 300KB if possible)

## Implementation
1. Once you have created/obtained the image, place it in the `public/images` directory
2. The image will be displayed when users click "Show preview map" in the AreYouAtRisk section
3. The image will have an overlay with CTA to call for more information
